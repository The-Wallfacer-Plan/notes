#John von Neumann: Genius of Man and Machine - a Biography

#[传记]约翰.冯.诺依曼：人类与机器界的天才

John von Neumann, one of this century’s preeminent scientists, along with being a great mathematician and physicist, was an early pioneer in fields such as game theory, nuclear deterrence, and modern computing. His was a mind comfortable in the realms of both man and machine. His kinship with  the logical machine was displayed at an early age by his ability to compute the product of two eight-digit numbers in his head. His strong and lasting influence on the human world is apparent through his many friends and admirers who so often had comments as to von Neumann’s greatness as a man and a scientist.

作为本世纪（20世纪）的杰出科学家之一，约翰.冯.诺依曼（John von Neumann）不仅是一个伟大的数学家和物理学家，他还是诸如博弈论、核威慑和现代计算机技术等领域的早期先驱。对于人类和机器领域的问题，他都有得心应手处理的头脑。还在很小的时候，他就可以口算两个八位数之积，这表现出了他在逻辑机器上与生俱来的天赋。他对人类世界的强大而持久的影响是显然的，这可以通过他的很多朋友和崇拜者看出，他们经常称颂冯.诺依曼作为一个人和一名科学家的伟大。

Although he is often well known for his dominance of logic and rigorous mathematical science, von Neumann’s genius can be said to have grown from a comfortable and relaxed upbringing.

尽管冯.诺依曼经常以他在逻辑性强且缜密的数学科学上的不可撼动地位而著名，他的天赋却可说来自于一个轻松、缓和的成长环境。 

#Early Life and Education in Budapest

#在布达佩斯（Budapest）的早期生活和教育

He was born Neumann Janos on December 28, 1903, in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. He was the first born son of Neumann Miksa and Kann Margit. In Hungarian, the family name appears before the given name. So, in English, the parent’s names would be Max Neumann and Margaret Kann. Max Neumann purchased a title early in his son’s life, and so became von Neumann.

在1903年12月28日，冯.诺依曼（Neumann János）出生在匈牙利（Hungary）首都布达佩斯。他是诺依曼.马克萨（Neumann Miksa）和肯.马吉特（Kann Margit）的第一个孩子。在匈牙利语中，姓出现在名之前。因而，在英语里，父母的名字将是马克思.诺依曼（Max Neumann）和玛格丽特.肯（Margaret Kann）。马克思.诺依曼在他儿子早年买了一个头衔，因此有了冯.诺依曼（von Neumann）的称呼。

Max Neumann, born 1870, arrived in Budapest in the late 1880s. He was a non-practicing Hungarian Jew with a good education. He became a doctor of laws and then worked as a lawyer for a bank. He had a good marriage to Margaret, who came from a prosperous family.

马克思.诺依曼生于1870年,他在19世纪80年代晚期来到布达佩斯。他是一个受过良好的教育非本地匈牙利犹太人。获得法学博士学位之后他成为了一家银行的律师。他和玛格丽特有一段美好的婚姻，玛格丽特来自一个兴旺的家族。

In 1903, Budapest was growing rapidly, a booming, intellectual capital. It is said that the Budapest that von Neumann was born into "was about to produce one of the most glittering single generations of scientists, writers, artists, musicians, and useful expatriate millionaires to come from one small community since the city-states of the Italian Renaissance."[1] Indeed, John von Neumann was one of those who, through his natural genius and prosperous family, was able to excel in the elitist educational system of the time.

在1903年，布达佩斯是一个迅速发展、欣欣向荣和智力导向型的城市。据说冯.诺依曼出生时期的布达佩斯在“城邦意大利文艺复兴时期以来将诞生一代来自小的团体的最耀眼的科学家、作家、艺术家、音乐家和有用的侨居百万富翁”。诚然，冯.诺依曼由于其自身禀赋和繁荣的家庭背景，成为当时精英教育体系中脱颖而出的佼佼者。

At a very young age, von Neumann was interested in math, the nature of numbers and the logic of the world around him. Even at age six, when his mother once stared aimlessly in front of her, he asked, "What are you calculating?" thus displaying his natural affinity for numbers. The young von Neumann was not only interested in math, though. Just as in his adult life he would claim fame in a wide range of disciplines (and be declared a genius in each one), he also had varying interests as a child. At age eight he became fascinated by history and read all forty-four volumes of the universal history, which resided in the family’s library. Even this early, von Neumann showed that he was comfortable applying his mind to both the logical and social world.

浸身于数字本体和逻辑世界中的冯.诺依曼在很小时候就对数学感兴趣。甚至当他六岁时，母亲某次漫不经心地在他面前盯着他看时，他却问：“您在计算什么呢？”这表现出他与生俱来的对数字的亲密关系。然而年轻时的冯.诺依曼就不仅对数学感兴趣了。在他的成年时期，他常常在很广泛的学科里希求扬名（且在每个学科中被称为天才），他还有作为小孩的很多兴趣。在八岁时他对历史疯狂着迷并读完了存放在他家图书馆的全部四十四卷通史。如此之早，冯.诺依曼就表现出对逻辑世界和人际世界的杰出头脑。

His parents encouraged him in every interest, but were careful not to push their young son, as many parents are apt to do when they find they have a genius for a child. This allowed von Neumann to develop not only a powerful intellect but what many people considered a likable personality as well.

他的父母在各个方面都鼓励他。不像其他家长发现生了一个天才儿童之后常常做的那样，父母尽量小心不刻意要求他。

It was never in question that von Neumann would attend university, and in 1914, at the age of 10, the educational road to the university started at the Lutheran Gymnasium. This was one of the three best institutions of its kind in Budapest at the time and gave von Neumann the opportunity to develop his great intellect. Before he would graduate from this high school he would be considered a colleague by most of the university mathematicians. His first paper was published in 1922, when he was 17, in the Journal of the German Mathematical Society, dealing with the zeros of certain minimal polynomials.

毫无疑问，冯.诺依曼会上大学。1914年，在他10岁时，他的通向大学教育之路从路德教会预科班开始。当时这是一所在布达佩斯同类机构中最好的三所学院之一。它给了冯.诺依曼一个开发智力的机会。从这所高中毕业之前，他已被大学的数学研究者们视为同僚了。他的第一篇论文发表于1922年，刊登在德国数学社会期刊（the Journal of the German Mathematical Society）上，当时他17岁。这是一篇讨论某类极小多项式零点的文章。

#University — Berlin, Zurich and Budapest

#在柏林、苏黎世和布达佩斯的大学生活

In 1921 von Neumann was sent to become a chemical engineer at the      University of Berlin and then to Zurich two years later. Though John von  Neumann had little interest in either chemistry or engineering, his father was a practical man and encouraged this path. At that time chemical engineering was a popular career that almost guaranteed a good living, in part due to the success of German chemists from 1914 to 1918. So, von Neumann set on the road planned in part by his father Max. He would spend two years in Berlin in a non-degree chemistry program. After this he would take the entrance exam for second year standing in the chemical engineering program at the prestigious Eidgennossische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich, where Einstein had failed the entrance exam in 1895 and then gained acceptance a year later.

1921年，他的父母把冯.诺依曼送往柏林大学（University of Berlin）希望他成为一名化学工程师；两年之后他去了苏黎世（Zurich）。冯.诺依曼对化学和工程几乎没有兴趣，他父亲却是一个现实的人并鼓励他走这条路。那时化学工程学是一项很热门的职业，它几乎可以确保好的生计，这部分归功于1914年到1918年德国化学的成功。因此，冯.诺依曼踏上了部分由他父亲马克思计划好了的道路。他在柏林的一个没有学位的化学项目里呆了两年。这之后，他参加了声名显赫的苏黎世联邦高等工业学院（Eidgen?ssische Technische Hochschule，ETH）次年化学工程资格允许入学考试——爱因斯坦（Einstein）曾与1895年在这里考试失利并于一年之后被接纳。

During this time of practical undergraduate study, von Neumann was executing another plan that was more in tune with his interests. In the summer after his studies at Berlin and before he went to Zurich he enrolled at the Budapest University as a candidate for an advanced doctorate in mathematics. His Ph.D. thesis was to attempt the axiomatization of set theory, developed by George Cantor. At the time, this was one of the hot topics in mathematics and had already been studied by great professors, causing a great deal of trouble to most of them. None the less, the young von Neumann, devising and executing this plan at the age of 17, was not one to shy away from great intellectual challenges.

在这一实用性本科学习中，冯.诺依曼正进行着另一个与他的兴趣更为一致的计划。在去柏林学习之后、苏黎世之前的那个暑假，他以数学高级博士候选人的身份进入了布达佩斯大学。他的博士论文尝试集合论的公理化，这一理论首先被乔治.康托（George Cantor）提出。当时这已成为数学界的热点话题之一，这一理论被一些伟大的教授们研究过，并给他们带来了相当大的麻烦。然而，年轻的冯.诺依曼并不对这一大的智力挑战退缩，他在17岁时提出并实施了他的方案。

Von Neumann breezed through his two years at Berlin and then set himself to the work on chemical engineering at the ETH and his mathematical studies in Budapest. He received excellent grades at the ETH, even for classes he almost never attended. He received a perfect mark of 6 in each of his courses during his first semester in the winter of 1923-24; courses including organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, experimental physics, higher mathematics and French language.

冯.诺依曼在柏林轻而易举地度过了两年并同时致力于在ETH的化学工程和在布达佩斯数学学习的工作。他在ETH取得了优异的成绩，甚至对他从未上过的课也一样。在1923年到1924年冬季第一个学期里他每门功课均取得了6分的完美绩点，这些课程包括有机化学、无机化学、分析化学、实验物理、高等数学和法语。

From time to time he would visit Budapest University when his studies there required his presence and to visit his family. He worked on his set theory thesis in Zurich while completing classes for the ETH. After finishing his thesis he took the final exams in Budapest to receive his Ph.D. with highest honors. This was just after his graduation from the ETH, so in 1926 he had two degrees, one an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and the other a Ph.D. in mathematics, all by the time he was twenty-two.

他总是会在那儿的学习需要他出席的时候访问布达佩斯大学并看望他的家人。在完成ETH课程的同时他在苏黎世写出了他的集合论论文。完成论文之后他在布达佩斯参加了博士结业考试并取得了最高荣耀，这刚好在他毕业于ETH之后。因而，1926年他取得了两个学位——一个是在化学工程学上的本科学位，另一个是数学博士学位，这些都是在他22岁前获得的。
 

#Quantum Mechanics

#量子力学

Von Neumann was a creative and original thinker, but he also had the ability to take other people’s suggestions and concepts and in short order turn them into something much more complete and logical. This is in a way what he did with quantum mechanics after he went to the university in G?ttingen, Germany after receiving his degrees in 1926.

冯.诺依曼是一个有原创性的思考者，同时他也有接收他人建议和观念并立即把它们钻变的更全面、更具逻辑性的能力。他在1926年取得学位之后去德国哥廷根大学（the university in G?ttingen）对量子力学所做的就是这样。

Quantum mechanics deals with the nature of atomic particles and the laws that govern their actions. Theories of quantum mechanics began to appear to confront the discrepancies that occurred when one used purely Newtonian physics to describe the observations of atomic particles.

量子力学研究的是原子粒子以及其行为遵守的定律。在使用纯牛顿物理描述原子粒子现象遇到不符时，量子力学理论开始出现了。

One of these observations has to do with the wavelengths of light that atoms can absorb and emit. For example, hydrogen atoms absorb energy at 656.3 nm, 486.1 nm, 434.0 nm or 410.2 nm, but not the wavelengths in between. This was contrary to the principles of physics as they were at the end of the nineteenth century, which would predict that an electron orbiting the nucleus in an atom should radiate all wavelengths of light, therefore losing energy and quickly falling into the nucleus. This is obviously not what is observed, so a new theory of quanta was introduced by Berliner Max Plank in 1900 that said energy could only be emitted in certain definable packets.

这些需要处理的观察之一是原子可以吸收和释放的光波波长。例如，氢原子吸收656.3 nm, 486.1 nm, 434.0 nm 或 410.2 nm的波长，但不吸收它们任两者之间的波长。这和十九世纪末的物理学原理相悖——那些远离预言原子内环绕原子核的电子应当辐射所有波长的光波，因此失去能量并快速陷入核中。很显然观察到的不是那样，因而一个新的量子理论于1900年被柏林人马克思.普朗克（Max Plank）引入，该理论指出能量仅可能被某些可定义微粒释放出。

This lead to two competing theories describing the nature of the atom, which could only absorb and emit energy in specific quanta. One of these, developed by Erwin Schr?dinger, suggested that the electron in hydrogen is analogous to a string in a musical instrument. Like a string, which emits a specific tone along with overtones, the electron would have a certain "tone" at which it would emit energy. Using this theory, Schr?dinger developed a wave equation for the electron that correctly predicted the wavelengths of light that hydrogen would emit.

这导致了两个竞争性的描述原子本质的理论，它们都基于仅仅可以在特殊量子吸收和释放能量这一观点。理论之一由珥文.薛定谔（Erwin Schr?dinger）提出，他指出氢原子中的电子和音乐乐器中的弦类似。正像弦协同弦外音释发出某一特殊音调一样，电子将会在某个音调释放能量。运用这一理论，薛定谔建立了电子的波动方程，正确地预言了氢原子释放的光波波长。

Another theory, developed by physicists at G?ttingen including Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan, focused on the position and momentum of an electron in an atom. They contested that these values were not directly observable (only the light emitted by the atom could be observed) and so could behave much differently from the motion of a particle in Newtonian physics. They theorized that the values of position and momentum should be described by mathematical constructs other than ordinary numbers. The calculations they used to describe the motion of the electron made use of matrices and matrix algebra.

另一理论由包括沃纳.海森堡（Werner Heisenberg）、马克思.伯恩（Max Born）和帕斯卡.约当（Pascual Jordan）在内的哥廷根物理学家们提出，它关注原子内电子的位置及动量。他们质疑这些值不可以直接观察（仅仅由原子释放的光可以被观测到），因此表现得和牛顿物理中的运动不同。他们推断位置和动量应当用数学构造而不是普通数字来表述。他们用于描述电子移动的计算利用了矩阵和矩阵代数。

These two systems, although apparently very different, were quickly determined to be mathematically equivalent, two forms of the same principle. The proponents of the two systems, none the less, denounced the others theories and claimed their own to be superior. It is in this environment, in 1926, that von Neumann appears on the scene and quickly went to work reconciling and advancing the theories of quantum mechanics.

尽管表面上迥异，这两种理论体系很快被论证在数学上等价，即它们是同一原理的两种形式。两种体系的支持者仍然责难其他理论并声明他们自己的更好。正是在这样的环境下，1926年冯.诺依曼出现了，他很快进行协调工作并推进了量子力学理论。

Von Neumann wanted to find what the two systems, wave mechanics and matrix mechanics, had in common. Through a more rigorous mathematical approach he wanted to find a new theory, more fundamental and powerful than the other two. He abstracted the two systems using an axiomatic approach, in which each logical state is the definite consequence of the previous state. Von Neumann constructed the rules of "abstract Hilbert space" to aid in his development of a mathematical structure for quantum theory. His formalism of the subject allowed considerable advances to be made by others and even predicted strange new consequences, one that consciousness and observations alone can affect electrons in the laboratory.[2]

冯.诺依曼希望找到波动力学和矩阵力学这两个体系的共同点。通过更为严密的数学方法，他想找到某种比两者更为基础、更为强大的新理论。他用公理化的方法抽象出了这两个体系，在这方法中逻辑状态是前一状态的确定结果。冯.诺依曼构造了“抽象希尔伯特空间”（abstract Hilbert space）为他建立量子理论的数学结构服务。他的对象形式化方法允许其他人做客观的改进，他甚至预言了奇怪的新结果，其中之一是仅意识和观察就可以影响实验室中的电子。

 

#Marriages and America

#婚姻和美国

From 1927-29, after his formalization of quantum mechanics, von Neumann traveled extensively to various academic conferences and colloquia and turned out mathematical papers at the rate of one a month at times. By the end of 1929 he had 32 papers to his name, all of them in German, and each written in a highly logical and orderly manner so that other mathematicians could easily incorporate von Neumann’s ideas into their own work.

1927年到1929年期间，在他的量子力学形式化工作之后，冯.诺依曼广泛出行到各种不同的学术大会和研讨会，有时候以每月一篇的速度发表数学论文。1929年末前他已经有冠以他名字的32篇论文了。

Von Neumann was now a rising star in the academic world, lecturing on new ideas, assisting other great minds of the time with their own works, and creating an image for himself as a likable and witty young genius in his early twenties. He would often avoid arguments with the more confrontational of his colleagues by telling one of his many jokes or stories, some of which he could not tell in the presence of ladies (though there were few women at these mathematical seminars). Other times he would bring up some interesting fact from ancient history, changing the subject and making von Neumann seem surprisingly learned for his age and professional interests.

冯.诺依曼这时成了学术界的一个新星。在二十几岁早些时候，他就开始演说新的见解、帮助其他伟大的精英完成他们的成果并为自己创造出一种讨人喜欢且机智的形象。他经常通过讲述笑话或故事来避开同事们的争执，其中不乏一些不可以在女士面前讲的内容（尽管在这些数学研讨会中几乎没有女性）。另外些时候，他会从古代历史中找出一些有趣事实来转变主题，这使得冯.诺依曼看起来在他所在年龄和专业兴趣上看起来是一个令人惊奇的博学之士。

Near the end of 1929 he was offered a lectureship at Princeton in an America that was trying to stimulate its mathematical sciences by seeking out the best of Europe. At this same time, von Neumann decided to marry Mariette Kovesi, whom he had known since his early childhood. Their honeymoon was a cruise across the Atlantic to New York, although most of their trip was subdued by Mariette’s unexpected seasickness.

将近1929年年末，他受邀到美国普林斯顿（Princeton）大学作一次演讲，普林斯顿大学想通过挑选欧洲数学界的杰出者来刺激它的数学科学的发展。那时，冯.诺依曼决定娶他从小就认识的马利蒂.科维斯（Mariette Kovesi）为妻。他们的蜜月是在从亚特兰大（Atlantic）到纽约的游艇上度过的，尽管大部分行程受马利蒂的出乎意料的晕船所限制。

They had a daughter, Marina, in 1935. Von Neumann was affectionate with his new daughter, but did not contribute to the care of her or to the housework, which he considered to be the job of the wife. The gap between the lively 26-year-old Mariette and the respectable 31-year-old John von Neumann began to increase and in 1936 they broke up, Mariette going home to Budapest and von Neumann, after drifting around Europe to various engagements, went to the United States. Soon after, on a trip to Budapest, he met Klari Dan and they were married in 1938.

1935年他们生了女儿玛丽娜（Marina）。冯.诺依曼对他的新生女儿很亲切，但他没有很关心她并辅导她的作业，因为他认为这是他妻子的工作。26岁的活泼少女马利蒂和31岁的受人尊敬的冯.诺依曼之间的分歧与日俱增，在1936年他们离了婚。马利蒂回到了布达佩斯的家，而冯.诺依曼则在欧洲各国漂流、参加了各种会议之后去了美国。不久，在一次去布达佩斯的旅行中，他遇到了克莱丽.丹（Klari Dan），1938年他们结婚了。

Although this marriage lasted longer than his first, von Neumann was often distant from his personal life, obsessed and engrossed in his thoughts and work. In this personal tradeoff of von Neumann’s the world of science profited tremendously, and much of his work changed all of our lives. Two of the most influential and well known of von Neumann’s interests during his time in America, from 1933 (when he was appointed as one of the few original members of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton) to 1957 (when he died of cancer), were the development of nuclear weapons and the invention of the modern digital computer.

尽管这次婚姻比他的第一次婚姻持续时间长，但冯.诺依曼常常离他的私生活很遥远，他总是全神贯注在他的想法和工作上。以冯.诺依曼在私人生活上的付出为代价，世界科学界获益很多，而大部分他的工作改变了世界。在1933年到1957年期间（其时他被任命为为数不多的几个普林斯顿高级研究所（Institute for Advanced Studies）的最初成员之一），核武器的研制和现代数字计算机的发明成了那时他在美国的两样最具影响力并因此闻名的成果。
 

#Von Neumann’s Role in Nuclear Development

#冯.诺依曼在在核武器发展中的贡献

In the biography of a genius such as von Neumann it would be easy to overestimate his role in the development of nuclear weapons in Los Alamos in 1943. It is important to remember that there was a collection of great minds there, recruited by the American government to produce what many saw as a necessary evil. The fear that Germany would produce an atomic bomb before the US drove the effort at Los Alamos.

在如冯.诺依曼这样的天才人物的传记中很容易过高评价他1943年在洛斯阿拉莫斯（Los Alamos）核武器研制中的作用。记住有一点是重要的：那儿有一大堆伟大聪明人应美国政府所募在研制一个很多人视为“必要的魔鬼”的东西。

Von Neumann’s two main contributions to the Los Alamos project were the mathematicization of development and his contributions to the implosion bomb.[3]

冯.诺依曼在洛斯阿拉莫斯工程中的两大主要贡献是他的数学化的建立和内爆炸弹。

The scientists at Los Alamos were used to doing scientific experiments but it’s difficult to do many experiments when developing weapons of mass destruction. They needed some way to predict what was going to happen in these complex reactions without actually performing them. Von Neumann therefore was a member of the team that invented modern mathematical modeling. He applied his math skills at every level, from helping upper officials to make logical decisions to knocking down tough calculations for those at the bottom of the ladder.

在洛斯阿拉莫斯的科学家习惯于做科学实验，但是当开发大规模杀伤性武器时做很多实验是非常困难的。他们需要在没有实际实验的情况下就可以预测在这些复杂的反应中将会发生的现象的某种方法。他在各个层次上应用了数学技巧，从帮助上级官员作出合乎逻辑的决定，到解决阶梯底部的复杂计算。

The atomic bombs that were eventually dropped were of two kinds, one using uranium-235 as its fissionable material, the other using plutonium. An atomic chain reaction occurs when the fissionable material present in the bomb reaches a critical mass, or density. In the uranium-235 bomb, this was done using the gun method. A large mass of uranium-235, still under the critical mass, would have another mass of uranium-235 shot into a cavity. The combined masses would then reach critical mass, where an uncontrolled nuclear fission reaction would occur. This process was known to work and was a relatively simple procedure. The difficult part was obtaining the uranium-235, which has to be separated from other isotopes of uranium, which are chemically identical.

最终落下的原子弹分为两类，一种用铀-235作为核裂变材料，另一种用钚。当炸弹内部当前核裂变物质达到了临界量或临界浓度时就会发生原子核链式反应。在铀-235炸弹中，这是通过击枪的方法实现的。大量仍处于临界量的铀-235让另一份铀-235射入腔中。结合起来的量于是达到了临界量，这时将会发生一个无法控制的原子核裂变反应。这一过程是可行的并且是一个相对简单的步骤。困难部分在于获得铀-235，必须把它从铀的同位素中分离出来，同位素在化学上是完全相同的。

Plutonium, on the other hand, can be separated using chemical means, and so production of plutonium based bombs could progress more quickly. The problem here was that plutonium bombs could not use the gun method. The plutonium would need to reach critical mass through another technique, implosion. Here, a mass of plutonium is completely surrounded by high explosives that are ignited simultaneously to cause the plutonium mass to compress to supercritical levels and explode.Although von Neumann did not arrive first at the implosion technique for plutonium, he was the one who made it work, developing the "implosion lens" of high explosives that would correctly compress the plutonium. This is just one more example of von Neumann’s ability to pick up an idea and advance it where others had gotten stuck.

另一方面，钚可以通过化学手段分离，基于钚的炸弹产品也可以进展更为迅速。这里的问题在于钚炸弹不可以使用击枪方式实现。钚将需要用另外的技术——爆缩，来达到临界量。在这里，大量钚完全被高浓度炸药包围，这些同时被点燃的炸药可以使得钚的量被压缩到一个超临界水平并引发爆炸。尽管冯.诺依曼没有第一个参与到钚炸弹的内爆炸技术中，他却是让它得以工作的人——他研制出了可以正确压缩钚的高浓度炸药“爆缩透鏡”。这正是另外一个冯.诺依曼在他人遇到困难时提出一个想法并发展它的例子。

 

#Development of Modern Computing

#现代计算技术的开发 

Just like the project at Los Alamos, the development of the modern computer was a collaborative effort including the ideas and effort of many great scientists. Also like the development of nuclear weaponry, there have been many volumes written about the development of modern computer. With so much involved in the process and von Neumann himself being involved in so much of it, only a few contributions can be covered here.Von Neumann’s experience with mathematical modeling at Los Alamos, and the computational tools he used there, gave him the experience he needed to push the development of the computer. Also, because of his far reaching and influential connections, through the IAS, Los Alamos, a number of Universities and his reputation as a mathematical genius, he was in a position to secure funding and resources to help develop the modern computer. In 1947 this was a very difficult task because computing was not yet a respected science. Most people saw computing only as making a bigger and faster calculator. Von Neumann on the other hand saw bigger possibilities.

正如在洛斯阿拉莫斯的工程一样，开发现代计算机是包含许多伟大的科学家的想法和努力的一次共同合作的尝试。同样和核武器发展类似，如今已经有了很多卷关于现代计算机的介绍。由于这个过程中涉及如此之多并且冯.诺依曼本人也涉及了其中很多方面，这里只能涵盖他的少数几个贡献。冯.诺依曼在洛斯阿拉莫斯的数学建模经历和他在那儿使用的计算工具，使得他有推进计算机发展的经验。同时，由于他的深远且具影响的关系网，通过IAS（高级研究所）、洛斯阿拉莫斯、很多大学及他的数学天才声望，他在保障基金和财力方面担任一职，来帮助开发现代计算机。在1947年，这是一项非常艰巨的任务，因为计算机技术那时并没成为一个受人尊敬的科学。大多数人至把计算机看作是一个更大、更快的计算器。另一方面，冯.诺依曼看到了更大的可能。

Von Neumann wanted computers to be put to use in all fields of science, bringing a more logical and precise nature to those fields as he had tried to do. With his contributions to the architecture of the computer, which describe how logical operations are represented by numbers that can then be read and processed, many von Neumann’s dreams have come true. Today we have extremely powerful computing machines used in scores of scientific fields, as well many more non-scientific fields.

冯.诺依曼希望计算机用于科学各个领域，像他所尝试的那样给那些领域引入更合逻辑、更为精确的本性特点。因为他对计算机体系结构所作的贡献——它描述了逻辑计算如何通过可读可处理的数字所表达，冯.诺依曼的很多梦想业已实现。今天我们有了在科学研究领域非常强大的计算机，同时我们也了有更多非科学领域的计算机。

In von Neumann’s later years, however, he worked and dreamed of applications for computers that have not yet been realized. He drew from his many other interests and imagined powerful combinations of the computer’s ability to perform logically and quickly with our brain’s unique ability to solve ill defined problems with little data, or life’s ability to self-reproduce and evolve.

然而，冯.诺依曼晚年梦想并致力的计算机应用迄今尚未实现。他有其他方面的很多兴趣，并想象计算机逻辑、迅速运行的能力和人脑独有的用极少数据处理不明确问题的能力或生命的自我繁殖演化能力的结合。

 In this vein, von Neumann developed a theory of artificial automata. Von Neumann believed that life was ultimately based on logic, and so any construct that supports logic should be able to support life. Artificial automata, like their natural counter parts, process information and proceed in their actions based on data received from their environment in light of rules and instructions they hold internally.

冯.诺依曼以他的方式发明了一套人工自动机理论。冯.诺依曼相信生命最终是基于逻辑的，因此任何支持逻辑的构造都必将对生命体有效。人工自动机正像它们自然的计数部件处理信息，同时按照它们内部的规则和指令根据由外部环境中接收到的数据来运行下去。

Cellular automata are a class of automata that exist in an infinite plane that is covered by square cells, much like a sheet of graph paper. Each of these cells can rest in a number of states. The whole plane of cells will go through time steps, where the new state of each cell is determined by its own state and the state of the cells neighboring it. In these simple actions there lies a great complexity and the basis for life like actions. Below is a schematic diagram of von Neumann’s self-reproducing cellular automaton.[4]

细胞组织自动机是一类自动机，它们存在于一个被方形细胞覆盖的无穷平面上，很像一个图纸表单。整个细胞平面将历经时间步骤（time step），在那里每个细胞的新的状态由它自己的状态和相邻细胞状态决定。这些简单的行为很复杂并包含了如生命活动这样的生命体基础。下面是冯.诺依曼的自我繁殖组织机器人的图解。



 

The automaton in this case, using the simple process described above, will produce an exact replica of itself, which can then reproduce on its own. The cells in the tape change states in such a way as to propagate into the tape control unit of the automaton, which reacts by changing the state of the "steady" cells outside itself. This constructs an arm that extends and forms a new automaton, exactly like the original.

使用上面提及到的简单步骤，这样运行的机器人将产生它自己的严格复制品，复制品之后也可以自我繁殖。磁带（tape）中的细胞单元用这种方式改变状态以传送到机器人的磁带控制（tape control）单元中，这通过改变它外部的稳定细胞单元的状态作出反应。这构成了一条可以延展并形成一个新的机器的手臂，和原始机器完全一样。
 

#Untimely End

#不合时宜的结局 

Perhaps all deaths can be considered to come too early; John von Neumann’s own death came far too early. He died on February 8, 1957, 18 months after he was diagnosed with cancer.

如果认为所有的死亡也许都来得很早，冯.诺依曼的死则来得太早了。他于1957年2月8日逝世，仅仅是在他被诊断出癌症之后18个月。

He never finished his work on automata theory, although he worked as long as he possibly could. He attended ceremonies held in his honor using a wheelchair, and tried to keep up appearances with his family and friends. Though he had accomplished so much in his years he could not accept death, could not consider a world that existed without his mind constantly thinking and solving. But today, his ideas live on and affect our lives in more ways than the few examples given here can demonstrate.

他没有完成他在自动机理论上的工作，尽管他尽可能长时间地为之奋斗。他坐在轮椅上参加了为了纪念他的庆典，并努力和他的家人和朋友一起露面。尽管在他的有生之年他有如此之多的成就，面对死亡他依旧不能释然，他不能想象一个没有他的大脑不停思考并解决问题的世界。但直到今天，他的想法继续存活了下来，并在远比在这里所举例子的更多方面影响着这我们的生活。
